# Continuous Integration Workflow
# 
# This workflow runs on every push and pull request to ensure code quality.
# It performs the following checks:
# 1. Type checking (TypeScript compilation without emitting files)
# 2. Linting (ESLint)
# 3. Testing (Jest)
# 4. Building (TypeScript compilation)
#
# The workflow uses pnpm as the package manager and supports multiple Node.js versions.
