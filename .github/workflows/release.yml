# Release Workflow
# 
# This workflow is triggered when a release is created or when code is pushed to main.
# It builds the production-ready code and can be extended to deploy to your hosting platform.
#
# Usage:
# - Create a release tag (e.g., v1.0.0) to trigger this workflow
# - Or push to main branch to build the latest version
